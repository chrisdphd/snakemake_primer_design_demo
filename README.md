# snakemake_primer_design_demo
A piece of python 2 code that will generate/enumerate PCR primer candidates from an input DNA sequence. 
Requires BioPython, for the Tm calculation. 
Also, a Snakemake file that will run that code (after correct env is setup), 
and some sample input files (in "input" dir).
And.... a .yaml envirnment file, for use in miniconda.
